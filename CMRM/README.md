Doremì consists in a music game, starring a young musician. The goal is to develop progressively more complex counterpoint melodies. The basic melody can be heard both in the level description phase, and subsequently, accompanied by a metronome that dictates the tempo. The user has the keys on the keyboard to play melodies useful for passing the level. Based on the quality of the user’s melody, and its interaction with the computer generated one, Doremì proceeds or recedes in overcoming obstacles. The goal of the game is to pass all the levels.
A melody is a linear succession of musical tones that the listener perceives as a single entity. In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color (...). Melodies often consist of one or more musical phrases or motifs, and are usually repeated throughout a composition in various forms. Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.
Counterpoint is the technique of writing independent melodic lines that work together to create effective music. The study of Counterpoint is essential knowledge for songwriters, composers, and
musicians who want to strengthen their compositional skills.
Musical textures are made of multiple “lines” of music (voices) that combine to form vertical sonorities. Studying counterpoint teaches us how to recognize and understand those lines
Counterpoint is the essence of what we call “voice leading”.

For the first specie of counterpoint we have a one-to-one relation between the main melody and counterpoint. In second species, it is introduce two intrinsically connected ideas: meter and
dissonance and  the CTP has two notes for every note of the main melody. In the third the CTP has four notes for every one note of the main melody.

The game is set in the Solar System, and each level corresponds to a different mood with which a planet, a modal scale and a color are associated.
In music theory, a mode is an ordered set of intervals derived from a corresponding scale by simply varying the initial note. 
Each way has its own character. The Ionic, among the major ways, is the most solar and rooted. The Doric, among the minor ones, is the most introspective and mysterious. While the Phrygian is closed, the Lydian is open and is able to make us dream and surprise us. Misolidium is the one with the most rhythm in the blood. It is no coincidence that it is the one used in blues and rock and roll. Wind power is that relating to the minor scale and therefore is the most melancholy, resigned and sad. Finally we have the Locrio, the strangest, unstable, suspended and indefinable one.
It is known that each color is associated with an emotion, the background color of each level underlines this fact. Thus orange represents enthusiasm and creativity, green growth and security, red courage and vigor, yellow light-heartedness, violet ambition, blue stability and finally black mystery.
In the same way in astrology the planets define well-established behaviors, the same ones that influence the melodic expressions of Doremì when he is there.
In the first level, starting from the basic concepts for the composition of a melody, it is necessary to create a counterpoint melody of the first specie by repeating the notes of the main melody. It takes place on Earth, the home planet of Doremì.
The second takes place on Mars, a vibrant planet for its colors. Misolidio modal scale is used.
In the third you are on Uranus, characterized by an introspective mood represented by the Doric modal scale.
Fourth planet, fourth level: Pluto and Locrio modal scale, to discover the limits of harmony and melody.
On the fifth planet we return to balance on Saturn. Percussion is also introduced. To pass the level it is necessary to create a counterpoint melody of the first or second species on the main one and following the indicated rhythmic pattern. Phrygian modal scale is used for the melody.
Melancholy characterizes level 6, on the Moon. Different sections will have to be created for the songs, a single melody cannot transmit a complete message, for this the B-sections are necessary. To pass the level you must create a third specie of counterpoint voice and always follow the backing track.
The last planet, Jupiter, represents awareness. To pass the level you must finally create a second or third species counterpoint voice adapting to changes in the backing track and addition of percussion.

The score is related to the melody produced by the user, for each correct note or chord and obstacle passed the score goes up by 50 points, for each error it goes down by 50. Victory is obtained if the level is concluded - all obstacles are overcome- with a score greater than 0.
